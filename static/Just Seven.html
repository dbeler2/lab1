            <p>Of all the numbers SEVEN stands the best. Shining, Shimmering, Splendid, A whole new world as they say.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The numbers were all equals until SEVEN appeared. The whole world trembles as she walks, Many were fallen by her gaze alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The world would never be the same again with the presence of SEVEN. The numbers are not enough to stop her, 
                The world needs someone to stop this omnipotent being before the world knows peace once again </p>
            <br>
            <p>The story of SEVEN now begins</p>
